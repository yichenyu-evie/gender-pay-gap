# Gender Pay Gap project
Work as Web designer & developer for the project

After immersive research on the pay gap between females and males through four different standards, by industries, by time, by race, by state, I organized all the data I collected into multiple JSON files and developed this data-driven interactive one-page website. Multiple JS plug-ins are utilized in the project, including D3, Highcharts, and DataTables.
